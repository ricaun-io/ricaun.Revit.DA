`ricaun.Revit.DA` package makes it easier to work with Design Automation, and fix some issues and limitations from the official Design Automation for Revit.

This project was generated by the [ricaun.AppLoader](https://ricaun.com/AppLoader/) Revit plugin.

## PackageReference

Install the `ricaun.Revit.DA` library from NuGet.

```xml
<PackageReference Include="ricaun.Revit.DA" Version="*" />
```

## Features

The main feature of this library is to fix some issues and limitations from the official Design Automation for Revit.

- Support `PackageContents.xml` with multiple versions - [Design Automation for Revit ignores PackageContents.xml configuration.](https://github.com/ricaun-io/RevitAddin.DA.Tester/issues/7)
- Support `ActiveAddInId` inside Design Automation ready event. - [Design Automation for Revit ActiveAddInId is null](https://github.com/ricaun-io/RevitAddin.DA.Tester/issues/9)

## DesignApplication

The `DesignApplication` is a base class with some abstractions to help you to execute Design Automation for Revit.

```C#
public class App : DesignApplication
{
    public override bool Execute(Application application, string filePath, Document document)
    {
        return true;
    }

    public override void OnStartup()
    {

    }

    public override void OnShutdown()
    {

    }
}
```

### Properties

#### ControlledApplication

The `ControlledApplication` stores the internal `ControlledApplication` from the `IExternalDBApplication`.
```C#
public override void OnStartup()
{
    ControlledApplication.ApplicationInitialized += (s, e) => { };
}
```

#### UseExternalService

The `UseExternalService` is `true` by default to force the Design Automation to support `ActiveAddInId` by executing the `Execute` inside the `ExternalService`.
```C#
public class App : DesignApplication
{
    public override bool UseExternalService => false; // true by default
}
```
